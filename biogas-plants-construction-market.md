<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Plants Construction Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Digestion</li><li>Dry Digestion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biogas plants construction encompasses two main market types: wet digestion and dry digestion. Wet digestion involves using a high-water-content feedstock, typically organic waste, in a liquid medium to facilitate microbial activity, resulting in biogas production. In contrast, dry digestion processes low-moisture substrates, usually solid biomass, in a more compact form, promoting efficient gas generation. Both methods cater to varying waste types and operational scales, influencing choice based on feedstock availability, technology, and economic factors in biogas production systems.</p></p>
