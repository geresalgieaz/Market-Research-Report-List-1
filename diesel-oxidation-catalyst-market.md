<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diesel Oxidation Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Activated Catalyst</li><li>Non-Activated Catalyst</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) market comprises two main types: activated and non-activated catalysts. Activated catalysts enhance the oxidative reactions at lower temperatures, improving efficiency and emissions reduction. They often contain precious metals like platinum or palladium. In contrast, non-activated catalysts operate primarily through passive oxidation processes and do not require additional heat for activation. They are generally less effective in extreme conditions but are more cost-effective and durable. Both types aim to minimize harmful emissions from diesel engines.</p></p>
