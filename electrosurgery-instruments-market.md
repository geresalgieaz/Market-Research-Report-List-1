<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrosurgery Instruments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bipolar</li><li>Monopolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electrosurgery instruments market is primarily divided into two main types: monopolar and bipolar systems. Monopolar instruments use a single active electrode, allowing current to flow through the body to a grounding pad, making them suitable for cutting and coagulation in larger tissue areas. In contrast, bipolar instruments utilize two electrodes within the surgical site, enabling precise control over tissue manipulation with minimal thermal spread. Both types are essential in surgical settings for their efficiency and effectiveness in various procedures.</p></p>
